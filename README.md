Using a Raspberry Pi and a camera, this application uses facial recognition to say your name.

## User Stories
* As a user, I want the system to recognize my face.
* As a user, I want the system to say my name if it does recognize me.
* As a user, if it does not recognize a person, I want it to either take a picture or start to record.
* As a developer I want to use a Raspberry Pi and facial recognition to be able to differentiate people.
* As a student, I want to create a project that is unique to what we have done in the past.
